# Bomb Busters Rules

> See the [official rulebook](Bomb%20Busters%20Rulebook.pdf) and [FAQ](Bomb%20Busters%20FAQ.pdf) for the complete published rules.

Bomb Busters is a co-op game best played with 4-5 players. Each player is given a tile stand which contains sorted wire tiles that is only visible to the player the stand belongs to. The goal of the game is to successfully cut all the wires, thus defusing the bomb and passing the mission.

## Game Components

- At least for now, only the starting components are used. New items in surprise boxes may be added later but are not supported at the moment.
- There are 5 tile stands, for up to 5 players. In this project, I am assuming a player count of 4 or 5 players where each player only plays and has information on one tile stand.
- There are 70 total wire tiles: 48 blue wires (4 of each number 1-12), 11 red wires numbered 1.5-11.5, 11 yellow wires numbered 1.1-11.1.
- 4 yellow markers and 3 red markers.
- 26 info tokens: 2 for each number 1-12 and 2 yellow tokens.
- 12 validation tokens which indicate when all wires of that number have been cut.
- An `=` token and a `!=` token to be used with equipment cards 12 and 1 respectively.
- 5 character cards with a personal item. The personal item is the Double Detector.
- 12 equipment cards.
- Multiple mission cards that provide different scenarios and challenges.

## Setup

1. Select a mission card to play.
2. Randomly shuffle all 48 blue tiles in addition to any red and/or yellow tiles as required by the mission card.
3. Designate a captain.
4. Deal the shuffled wires evenly, starting with the captain and going clockwise. For example, with 5 players and 52 total wires, the captain and the player to the captain's left will draw 11 wires, and all other players will draw 10 wires.
5. All players will sort all tiles on their rack in ascending order with no gaps between any tiles.
6. The captain will indicate first with an info token for any of their blue wires. Players indicate one blue wire in clockwise direction until all players have indicated once.
7. Play begins with the captain after all players have indicated. Each player must take one action per turn: dual cut, solo cut, or using equipment followed by a cut action.

## Game Play

Starting with the captain and going clockwise, each bomb disposal expert takes a turn. On their turn, the active bomb disposal expert must do one of the following 3 actions: Dual Cut, Solo Cut, or Reveal Your Red Wires.

### Dual Cut

The active bomb disposal expert must cut 2 identical wires: 1 of their own and 1 of their teammate's. They clearly point to a specific teammate's wire and guess what it is, stating its value (e.g., "This wire is a 9").

- If correct, the action succeeds:
  - The teammate places that wire faceup in front of their tile stand, without changing its position.
  - The active bomb disposal expert places their identical wire (or one of them if they have several) faceup in front of their tile stand.
- If wrong, the action fails:
  - If the wire is red, the bomb explodes and the mission ends in failure.
  - If the wire is blue or yellow, the detonator dial advances 1 space (the bomb explodes if the dial reaches the skull), and the teammate places an info token in front of the wire to show its real value.

### Solo Cut

If the last of identical wires still in the game appear only in the active bomb disposal expert's hand, they can cut those identical wires in pairs (either 2 or 4). This can be done on their own, without involving another bomb disposal expert.

- If they have a full set of 4, they can cut all 4 wires at once.
- If a pair of wires of a given value have already been cut, they can cut the remaining 2 matching wires in their hand.

Cut wires are placed faceup on the table in front of the tile stand.

### Reveal Your Red Wires

This action can occur only if the active bomb disposal expert's remaining uncut wires are all red. They reveal them, placing them faceup on the table in front of their tile stand.

### Validation Tokens

As soon as all 4 wires of the same value have been cut, place 1 validation token on the matching number on the board.

### Yellow Wires

Yellow wires are cut the same way as blue wires (Dual or Solo Cut), but the numeric value is used only when sorting the tiles on the stand in ascending order during setup. During the game, all yellow wires are considered to have the same value: "YELLOW". To cut a yellow wire, the active bomb disposal expert must have one in their hand, point to a teammate's wire, and say "This wire is yellow." If correct, the 2 wires are cut. If incorrect, an info token that reveals the actual value of the identified wire is placed, and the detonator dial advances 1 space.

- If a yellow wire is pointed at incorrectly, a yellow info token is used.
- A Solo Cut using yellow wires can occur only if the bomb disposal expert has all the remaining yellow wires in their hand.

## Character Cards

Every player is assigned a character card. One card is marked as the "Captain". The player with the Captain character card is the designated captain for this mission. 

Each bomb disposal expert can use the personal equipment on their character card once per mission. To show that it has been used, flip it facedown.

### Double Detector

The personal equipment that all players begin the game with is the Double Detector. Additional character card personal equipment is unlocked in further missions. 

**Double Detector:** During a Dual Cut action, the active bomb disposal expert states a value and points to 2 wires on a teammate's stand (instead of only 1).

- If either of these 2 wires matches the stated value, the action succeeds.
  - If both wires match, the teammate simply chooses which of the 2 chosen wires to cut.
- If neither of the 2 wires matches the stated value, the action fails.
  - The detonator dial advances 1 space, and the teammate places 1 info token in front of 1 of the 2 chosen wires (their choice).
  - If only 1 of the 2 chosen wires is red, the bomb does not explode. The teammate places an info token in front of the non-red wire without sharing any details.

### Triple Detector

This personal equipment is the same as the 3. Triple Detector equipment card. 

### X or Y ray

This personal equipment is the same as the 10. X or Y ray equipment card.

### General Radar

Can be used at any time

This personal equipment is the same as the 8. General Radar equipment card.

### Walkie-Talkies

Can be used at any time

This personal equipment is the same as the 2. Walkie-talkies equipment card. 

## Equipment

Equipment cards are placed on the board at the start of each mission. The number of equipment cards available is equal to the number of players in the mission. Equipment cards are unlocked when at least one set of wires matching the equipment card's number is successfully cut. Equipment cards can only be used once, and each has a different effect. 

Double numbered equipment cards are unlocked after beating mission 54. Four wires of the same value have to be cut for them to be used. 

### 1. Label !=

Can be used at any time

Put the != token in front of 2 adjacent wires of different values. 

- 1 of the 2 can already be cut.
- Reminder: Any 2 yellow wires or any 2 red wires are always considered identical. Therefore, they cannot be "different".

### 2. Walkie-Talkies

Can be used at any time

Swap 2 wires: 
1. Take 1 of your uncut wires and put it facedown in front of a teammate. 
2. That teammate does the same to you.
3. Each player takes their new wire and places it on their tile stand. 

- If a bomb disposal expert has 2 tile stands, they put the new wire in the stand they took the wire from. 
- Any uncut wire can be swapped (even red/yellow).
- Everyone sees where swapped wires come from and end up. 

### 3. Triple Detector

To use on your turn

During a Dual Cut action, you can state a value (but not a yellow one) and point to 3 wires on a teammate's tile stand.

- This equipment works like the "Double Detector," but with 3 wires. 

### 4. Post-It

Can be used at any time

Put 1 info token in front of 1 of your blue wires. 

### 5. Super Detector

During a Dual Cut action, you can state a value (but not yellow) and point at your teammate's whole tile stand.

- This equipment works like the "Double Detector," but with ALL wires in a tile stand. 

### 6. Rewinder

Can be used at any time

Move the detonator dial back 1 space. 

### 7. Emergency Batteries

Can be used at any time

Choose 1 or 2 character cards which have already been used and flip them faceup. Their personal equipment is once again usable this mission. 

### 8. General Radar

State a number between 1 and 12. All bomb disposal experts (including you) say "Yes!" if they have 1 or more uncut blue wires of that value on their stand. 

- If a bomb disposal expert has 2 tile stands, they answer separately for each stand. 

### 9. Stabilizer

To use at the start of your turn.

Flip it facedown BEFORE a Dual Cut action. 
During your turn: 
- If the action fails, the detonator dial does not move. 
- If a red wire is cut, the bomb does not explode. 

- If you pointed to a wrong wire, your teammate still puts an info token (number of yellow) in front of their hand. 

### 10. X or Y ray

To use on your turn

During a Dual Cut action, you can state 2 values when pointing at 1 wire (including yellow wires). 

- You must have both values in your hand.

### 11. Coffee Mug

To use on your turn

Skip your turn and choose who the next active bomb disposal expert (without consulting teammates).

### 12. Label =

Can be used at any time

Put the = token in front of 2 of your adjacent wires of the same value. 

- 1 of the 2 can already be cut
- Any 2 yellow wires or any 2 red wires are considered identical. 

### Yellow. False Bottom

Instant effect (Activated immediately after 2 yellow wires are successfully cut.)

Take 2 equipment cards and put them in the game with the others. 

- Depending on the wire values already cut, it is possible for these cards to be used immediately. 

### 2. 2. Single Wire Label

Can be used at any time

Put a x1 token in front of 1 of your blue wires (either cut or uncut). 

- This shows the indicated value is represented only once on the tile stand (cut wires included). 

### 3. 3. Emergency Drop

Instant effect

Immediately flip all used Equipment cards faceup. They can now be used again during this mission. 

### 9. 9. Fast Pass Card

To use on your turn

You can do a SOLO Cut action to cut 2 identical wires -- even if they are not the last remaining wires of that value. 


### 10. 10. Disintegrator

Instant effect

Take a random Info token from the supply. Reveal the number (1-12). All bomb disposal experts cut any remaining wires they have matching this value. 

### 11. 11. Grappling Hook

Can be used at any time

Point at a teammate's wire, take it without revealing it, and put it in order in your hand. 

- Everyone sees where this wire comes from and ends up. 

## Indicator Tokens

There are a variety of different indicator tokens that convey information about a players board in different ways. More indicator tokens are unlocked in later missions. Typically, only one type of info token is available during the mission. 

### Info Tokens

The basic info token. Numbered 1 through 12, these are used to mark that a specific wire is a blue wire of a specific value. They are sometimes also used to indicate that a player does not have a blue wire of this value. 

These are also sometimes used to indicate that a wire is NOT the value marked by the tile. 

### Yellow info tokens

Also available at the start of the game, these tokens act similarly to the info tokens, but are used to indicate that a specific wire is a yellow wire. Since yellow wires have a value of "Yellow", the indicator token does not give away what the yellow wire's sort value is, just that it is yellow. 

These are often only used when someone fails a dual cut action on a yellow wire, and that yellow wire gets indicated. 

For the purpose of using info tokens in the setup, yellow info tokens are considered in the pool of info tokens. 

### X tokens

These are used to mark a wire that is NOT sorted with the rest of the stand. 

In some missions the wire can be any color. In other missions it may be limited to blue wires. The other wires are shuffled, dealt, and sorted as normal. 

Often, wires marked by X tokens can not be cut with the help of an equipment card. This means that all personal equipment, Super Detector (5), and General Radar (8) will not work on this wire. For General Radar (8) the wire is not part of the group of wires that can be detected. 

### Even and Odd tokens

These wires are used to indicate if a wire is even (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) or odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 11). There are separate tokens for even wires and odd wires. They often will replace the standard info tokens in missions.

These are used in some missions to indicate that a wire is even or odd, without giving away it's exact numerical value. 

### x1 x2 x3 Tokens

These tokens show that the indicated value is present once, twice, or three times on that tile stand (including any already cut wires). The x2 and x3 can be placed on any wire of that value. They will often replace the standard info tokens in missions. 

Since these tokens are often used in place of standard info tokens, you won't know the numerical value of the wire. But it does help narrow down the adjacent wires. Since a x1 token means that none of its neighbors are the same value, a x2 token means that one of it's neighbors is the same value, and a x3 token means that there are three matching numbers of this value. Since the tokens can be placed anywhere, a x3 token does not guarantee which of it's neighbors (up to two away) could be matching. 

There is no x4 token, presumably because if you had four of the same wires, you'd solo cut them. 


## Cards 

In later missions, additional cards are added to the game that are used in missions for various effects. 

### Number cards

Twelve cards numbered 1 through 12 are used in different missions to indicate different numbers. These could be used to represent a required cut order, or to place certain conditions of wires that match that number. 

### Sequence card

A single card often used in conjunction with the Number cards to indicate that some wires must be cut in a certain order. 

### Constraint cards 

Constraint cards apply a constraint players for some part of the mission. They might be applied to specific players for the entire mission, or every player in the game for some period of time. Each card has a different effect. The cards are identified by their letter. 

When a bomb disposal expert cannot apply their constraint at the start of their turn, they flip the card facedown and continue playing as usual for the rest of the game. 

- A. You must cut only EVEN wires. 
- B. You must cut only ODD wires. 
- C. You must cut only wires 1 to 6.
- D. You must cut only wires 7 to 12. 
- E. You must cut only wires 4 to 9.
- F. You CANNOT cut wires 4 to 9.
- G. You CANNOT use Equipment cards or your own personal equipment.
- H. If your cut fails or a cut in your hand FAILS, do not place an Info token (and do not reveal the value). You CANNOT cut a wire indicated by an info token. P.S. Equipment 4 (Post-It) cannot be used. 
- I. You CANNOT cut the far-right wire (hightest number) on your teammates' tile stands.
- J. You CANNOT cut the far-left wire (lowest number) on your teammate's tile stands.
- K. You CANNOT do a Solo Cut action.
- L. If the cut FAILS, advance the detonator dial 2 spaces (instead of 1).

### Challenge cards

Challenge cards are unlocked after beating mission 54. A Challenge card shows a condition: the CHALLENGE is successful if this condition is fulfilled. It may apply to only 1 bomb disposal expert, e.g. the arrangement of wires on a tile stand, or to the whole team, e.g. describing a sequence of wires to cut. The cards are identified by their number. 

1. Instead of their action, a bomb disposal expert cuts a teammate's wire, saying "It is RED." If that wire is not RED, the bomb explodes! 
2. 4 bomb disposal experts consecutively cut EVEN numbers. 
3. Uncut wires on a tile stand consist of 2-wire pairs (separated by cut wires).
4. The sum of the first 3 Validation tokens used equals 18.
5. 2 bomb disposal experts consecutively perform the SOLO Cut action. 
6. On a single tile stand, at least 5 uncut wires have been isolated (the adjacent wires have been cut).
7. 3 bomb disposal experts consecutively cut sequential values (either up or down). Examples: 8-9-10 or 5-4-3. 
8. The first 2 Validation tokens are put on these numbers: Put 2 faceup Number cards HERE. 
9. A tile stand has only uncut ODD wires (a minimum of 6 wires). Ignore RED and YELLOW wires. 
10. On a single tile stand, at least 7 wires have been but, but the 2 wires on each end have not been cut yet. 


## End of the Game

The mission ends in success when all bomb disposal experts have empty tile stands.

If the mission ends in failure (red wire cut or detonator dial reaches the skull), change which player is the captain and restart the mission.

## Strategy Tips

- If a player attempts and fails a dual cut, we know they have at least one wire of the guessed value. The probability engine uses this deduction automatically via the "must-have" constraint system.
- You can narrow down possibilities on someone's tile stand by referencing which values are fully validated (all 4 cut). Those numbers cannot exist on anyone's stand.

## Missions

This section describes the setup and rules for the different missions in the game. The information here is primarily used to construct the dataclasses of different missions for faster game setup. This should not be considered a complete exhaustive list of all mission cards, rules, and flavor text. Partly because it isn't necessarily to include, but also because I want to respect the game's IP and not include content from the game that isn't relevant to this calculator. 

All missions are numbered and missions are played in order with increasing complexity. There are 66 total missions in the game. Each mission has a mission number, title, flavor text, setup, modifications for 2 or 3 players, and sometimes mission specific instructions. Since this calculator only supports 4-5 player arrangements, the rule exceptions for 2-3 players are ignored.

Setup:
- Blue wires 1-6 only
- No equipment

### 2. TRAINING, Day 2

- 1 of 2 red wires
- 2 of 3 yellow wires

### 9. A Sense of Priorities

Setup:
- 1 red wire
- 2 yellow wires
- 3 Number cards
- 1 Sequence card
- Yellow equipment card gets added to the pool of possible equipment for this mission and all missions after this. If it is drawn but there are no yellow wires in the setup, replace it with a different equipment card. 

Shuffle the Number cards, draw 3 of them, and set them faceup in a line on the table. Place the Sequence card (side A) above the leftmost card.

### 10. A Rough Patch

Setup:
- 1 red wire
- 4 yellow wires

### 13. Red Alert!

Setup: 
- 3 red wires
  - Instead of shuffling the red wires into the pool, they are randomly dealt to players one at a time starting with the captain and continuing clockwise. As a result, we know exactly who has red wires and how many they have. 
- During the Info token setup phase, each player takes an info token from the pool randomly and places it on their stand. If they have that value, they can place it in front of any matching wire. If they do not have that value, it is placed to the side of their stand showing a player-does-not-have constraint.

### 17. Rhett Herrings

Setup:
- 2 of 3 red wires

Info tokens are placed normally for all players except for the captain. The captain is designated as the "Rhett Herring". For the captain only, they choose and place 2 info tokens that must be fake. They can not be placed in front of a red wire. These tokens indicate a must-not-be-value constraint. Everyone else places info tokens as normal. 

### 18. BAT-Helping-Hand

Setup:
- 1 red wire
- 2 of 3 yellow wires

### 20. The Big Bad Wolf

Setup: 
- 2 red wires
- 2 yellow wires
- 1 X token per player
- Equipment 2. Walkie-talkie is not allowed 

The last wire dealt to each tile stand is not sorted in ascending order, but is put on the far right end of the stand (regardless of its value). Put a X token in front to indicate this wire. (The X wire can be any color).



### 21. Death by Haggis

Setup:
